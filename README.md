This is a basic program take from a basic games book, (can't remember which one) adapted to use the VT102 escape codes for plot positioning. This creates a maze of the size you specify. 
once run, simply type in the 2 dimensons seperated by a comma eg 8,8 and hit return.
I recall I adjusted to use the VT102 escape codes on the RC2014/SC108 and minor tweaks to make it look nice.
